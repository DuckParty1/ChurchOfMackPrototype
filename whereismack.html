        <p class = "textbox">Mack has most recently been sighted around the city of Brisbane blessing the locals with his presence and good vibes. 
            If you keep an eye out you may just see him, perhaps even at a local dog park. Pictured below is the most recent sighting of Mack in public.
            Notice his signature blonde tinted hair<br><br><br>
