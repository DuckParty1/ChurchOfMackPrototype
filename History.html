        <h1><br><b> The History of Mack </b></h1>

        <p class = "textbox"> Mack was born July 18, 2009. This may seem like a fairly late time for the savior of us all to be born, but try to think of it as his day of birth just being the date he was given physical form. He was watching and waiting for the right time to reveal himself to the populace. As such, we are lucky to be alive at the same time as this monumental event that is the founding of Mackology.
        Some even argue that all time before the physical manifestation of Mack (BM) is irrelevant, and had rancid vibes.
        <br>

        Since his birth, he has endeavored to the improve the general vibes of the world. A noble cause.

        The only request he makes is proper care of ones own pets, and belly rubs as often as you like.
