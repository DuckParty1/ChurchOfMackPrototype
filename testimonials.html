            "Something happened to me in the summer of 2001 that turned even a rabid non-believer like me onto the one true path of Mack.
            On the day in question, I had a sudden craving for a Big Mac, so I went to my local Maccas and ordered a large Big Mac meal. But ten minutes later, there was still no sign of the double-layered beefy goodness. I wasn’t 
            leaving without my burger though, so I hunched myself down next to the counter like I was bracing for a snowstorm, and waited. At some point, I must’ve fallen asleep, because all I remember is seeing darkness all around me, 
            except for a tiny pinprick of white. As I watched, the pinprick grew bigger and bigger, until I could see that it was actually a fuzzy ball of bright white light getting closer and closer. 
            Eventually, I could make out the face of a small white dog in the centre of the light, and that the light was actually its fur, stretching out in all directions like a massive sea urchin. 
            The dog looked at me solemnly, and even though its mouth didn’t move, I heard its voice inside my head. It spoke to me in a series of high-pitched barks and growls. 
            I don’t know how I understood it, since I don’t speak dog, but somehow, I did. "You worship a false god", it ruffed. Renounce your grease-laden deity, and be welcomed into the embrace of the true Big Mack.
            I haven’t been able to stomach a Big Mac since. If this wasn’t an act of god, I don’t know what is."

            "I once prayed to Mack to deliver me from my sins, and he came to me in a dream. He looked like a huge fuzzy white ball with a dog's face in the centre. 
            As I watched, his hairs starting falling off one by one, except for the hair on his face, until he was just a wrinkly little naked-mole-rat-looking creature with the face of a little white dog. 
            The fallen hairs wrapped around me like a nest, and I felt so warm and comforted, I shed tears of joy. When I woke up, all of my clothing was covered in white fur and smelled like wet dog. #blessed"
