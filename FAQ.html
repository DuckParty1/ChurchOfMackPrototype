<!---This page could theoretically have the FAQ listed on both sides of the page to save on space,
     but it is intended to be a bit of a rabbit hole and so directing the user in the correct opening position is better here.
    Also, javascript imports are done at the bottom to collect information on all collapsible elements after DOM.-->
